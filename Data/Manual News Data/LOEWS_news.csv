12.02.2018;"LOEWS CORPORATION REPORTS NET INCOME OF $1.16 BILLION FOR 2017NET INCOME FOR 2017 OF $964 MILLION EXCLUDING SIGNIFICANT TAX ITEM. NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) today reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $1.16 billion, or $3.45 per share, compared to $654 million, or $1.93 per share, in the prior year. Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017was $481 million, or $1.43 per share, compared to $290 million, or $0.86 per share, in the prior year period.Net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017includes a significant net benefit of $200 million, or $0.59 per share, resulting from the enactment on December 22, 2017 of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the ""Tax Act"") (a). The net benefit primarily relates to the remeasurement of Loews's net deferred tax liability precipitated by the lowering of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate. Page seven of this release shows the impact of the remeasurement by segment.Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, net income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 would have been $281 million and $964 million, or $0.83 and $2.86 per share.Book value per share increased to $57.83 at December 31, 2017 from $53.96at December 31, 2016. Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (""AOCI"") increased to $57.91 at December 31, 2017from $54.62 at December 31, 2016. Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to 2016Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased as compared to the prior year period mainly due to the impact of the Tax Act. Absent this net tax benefit, net income decreased $9 million as higher earnings at CNA Financial Corporation and Loews Hotels & Co were offset by lower results at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc.CNA's earnings were affected by a $78 million net charge related to the Tax Act. Absent this charge, earnings increased due to higher favorable net prior year development and improved current accident year underwriting results from its property and casualty operations, partially offset by lower net investment income.Diamond Offshore's earnings were affected by a $36 million net charge related to the Tax Act. Absent this charge, earnings decreased due to lower contract drilling revenue, higher contract drilling expense, an impairment charge related to the carrying value of a drilling rig and restructuring and separation costs.Boardwalk Pipeline's earnings were affected by a $294 million net benefit related to the Tax Act. Absent this benefit, earnings were consistent with the prior year as higher revenues from growth projects recently placed into service were offset by a decrease in storage and parking and lending revenues and a decrease in revenues associated with the sale of the Flag City processing plant and the restructuring of a firm transportation customer contract. Earnings were helped by lower interest expense.Loews Hotels' earnings were affected by a $27 million net benefit related to the Tax Act. Absent this benefit, earnings increased due to improved performance at several large properties, including the Loews Miami Beach Hotel which had been under renovation in the prior year quarter, and higher equity income from the Universal Orlando joint venture properties.Income generated by the parent company investment portfolio was consistent with the prior year and reflects lower performance from limited partnership investments, offset by improved results from gold-related securities.Corporate and other results were affected by a $7 million net charge related to the Tax Act. Absent this charge, operating expenses decreased mainly due to the timing of compensation accruals.Years Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to 2016Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased as compared to the prior year partially due to the net benefit from the Tax Act as discussed above. Absent the benefit, net income increased $310 millionprimarily from higher earnings at CNA, Loews Hotels and Diamond Offshore.The following discussion excludes the impact on each segment of the Tax Act, which is included in the quarterly discussion.CNA's earnings increased due to improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results from its property and casualty operations, higher net investment income driven by improved limited partnership results, higher realized investment gains and lower adverse reserve development from CNA's 2010 asbestos and environmental pollution loss portfolio transfer. These increases were partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses and a charge related to the early redemption of debt in the third quarter of 2017.Diamond Offshore's results improved due to a $235 million decrease in asset impairment charges and lower depreciation expense resulting mainly from the asset impairment charges taken in 2016 and in the first half of 2017 that reduced the depreciable asset base. These increases were partially offset by lower contract drilling revenue, higher contract drilling expense, higher interest expense and a charge related to the early redemption of debt in the third quarter of 2017.Boardwalk Pipeline's earnings decreased slightly due to the loss on sale of the Flag City processing plant in the second quarter of 2017, lower storage and parking and lending revenues and a decrease in revenues related to the restructuring of a firm transportation customer contract, mostly offset by revenues from growth projects recently placed into service. Boardwalk also benefited from lower interest expense due to higher capitalized interest related to growth projects.Loews Hotels' earnings increased primarily due to higher joint venture equity income, which included a net benefit of $14 million (after tax) primarily related to an asset sale in the first quarter of 2017. Improved performance at several large properties, including the completion of renovations at the Loews Miami Beach Hotel in early 2017, also drove the increase.Income generated by the parent company investment portfolio was consistent with the prior year.Corporate and other results decreased due to higher operating expenses from costs related to the acquisition of Consolidated Container in May 2017.SHARE REPURCHASESAt December 31, 2017, there were 332.1 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 4.6 million and 4.8 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $231 million and $237 million. From January 1, 2018 to February 9, 2018, the Company repurchased an additional 4.3 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $218 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company may from time to time purchase shares of its and its subsidiaries' outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.CONFERENCE CALLSA conference call to discuss the fourth quarter results of Loews Corporation has been scheduled for today at 11:00 a.m. EST.

07.02.2018;"Loews expands ‘immersive’ strategy to grow portfolio. Loews Hotels & Co.'s long-standing presence in the Orlando market provides a solid backdrop for its expansion into other destination-oriented projects, according to executive Alex Tisch. By  Jeff HigleyLOS ANGELES—Loews Hotels & Co. is in the process of increasing its portfolio size by 25% by doubling down on a strategy that has given it a prominent presence in the Orlando market.“We call that strategy ‘immersive destinations’—where the demand generator isn’t really the city,” said Alex Tisch, EVP of commercial and business development of Loews Hotels & Co. “It’s the project or who we’re building in conjunction with.”New York-based Loews has 24 hotels in its portfolio with six in various phases of development: three in Orlando, one in Arlington, Texas, one in St. Louis and one in Kansas City. “We found this white space where we find a lot of interesting construction development projects as a result of saying we want to be a great partner,” Tisch said during a break at the recent Americas Lodging Investment Summit. “We want to embrace the owner-operator model.”The Orlando projects will add to the five hotels the company already owns and/or manages in the market. The 600-room Aventura Hotel is scheduled to open in August. Loews’ two other hotels—which are being built on the site of the former Wet ’n Wild water park—will have a combined 2,800 rooms are scheduled to open in summer 2019.The assets at the 50-acre former water park site will be more value-oriented, and like some of the other hotels in Loews’ portfolio, they will not carry the Loews name. “We have a name, but there’s a copyright associated with it,” Tisch said. “This will be unbranded because we don’t want to create brand confusion with people think they’re going to a Loews Hotel.”Once the projects are open, Loews will have more than 9,000 guestrooms available in Orlando. The city continues to be a big part of Loews’ expansion strategy because of its 22-year partnership with Comcast NBC Universal, the parent company of Universal Orlando Resort.The value-oriented hotels play directly into Universal’s strategy to attract a wide variety of demographics to its theme parks in the market, Tisch said.“The Universal partnership in general, I think you’ll start to see it working like Disney, where they’ll have 5-star, 4-star, 3-star, 2-star keys,” Tisch said. “We’ll be their partner in them, but to put a brand associated with them is a bit difficult for consumer differentiation.”One relationship leads to a Live! One The relationship with Universal has provided somewhat of a blueprint for the company’s other expansion projects, Tisch said.“How do we take what we’ve done well with them and replicate that business model with others?” he said. “(It) is a difficult task. When we did that work, we found out that there’s all different kinds of demand generators.”Tisch, who is a cousin of Loews Hotels & Co. Chairman and CEO Jon Tisch, said the company has had contact over the years with members of The Cordish Companies, and until 2017 couldn’t find a project to work on together. Cordish is a real estate developer that during the past few years has turned to building entertainment complexes that have a hotel component.Loews officials quickly agreed to join forces with Baltimore-based Cordish on its Texas Live! project to develop a 300-room Live! by Loews Hotel near the Dallas Cowboys’ and Texas Rangers’ stadiums in Arlington, Texas.“We basically fell in love with the project,” Tisch said.Loews will own 50% and the Texas Rangers MLB club will own the other half, he added.“The built-in demand generator is obviously the team, and my hope is that we’ll be able to leverage the team and their partners’ database to market directly,” Tisch said. “I can’t say how many accounts they have, but it’s a significant amount with a 60,000-square-foot stadium.”The largest Six Flags amusement park also is located nearby.But the collaboration wasn’t finished, according to the Loews executive.“An hour later (Cordish) called me up and said, ‘Hey, why don’t you see what we’re doing in St. Louis?’” Tisch said.Loews officials went to see the project at St. Louis’ Ballpark Village surrounding Busch Stadium—home of the St. Louis Cardinals—and was sold on joining that project as well. It will include a 220-room Live! by Loews property. Loews will own 50% of the hotel and Cordish and the Cardinals will own the other 50%, Tisch said.“Those two teams are very much like demand generators at Universal,” Tisch said. “We’re a bit more limited in what we can do. We can’t have nine hotels, 9,000 keys like Universal, but certainly the project is worthy.”Kansas City project also takes off Loews’ other big project in the works is the $320-million, 800-room Loews Kansas City, which will be attached to the city’s convention center. Tisch said the city was struggling to put financing in place with another operator before Loews stepped in.“Our owner-operator story resonated pretty quickly with the city—the fact that we had the money to close and didn’t have to go look for it,” Tisch said.There are a number of subsidies involved in the project, Tisch said. However, the fact that it will create 2,000 jobs and Loews has an infinite hold period sold the city on the deal. Tisch said the project will allow the city to compete for conventions with markets such as Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; and Indianapolis.“The way we’re going to be able to compete with them is on price,” Tisch said. “The convention center is not getting a lot of business now. They’re getting local … because they don’t have a great hotel with them. Now they have a great hotel that’s subsidized by the city, we’re going to go and compete on price for the best business.”Loews contributed $60 million in equity, according to Tisch, and plans to have the hotel open in two years.Overall strategy includes being ‘asset heavy’ While Loews is focusing on these megaprojects, Tisch said the company still likes the third-party management model.“We love those assets, but as far as running as fast as we can to go get more, for a few hundred thousand dollars, it’s not a great use of our time,” Tisch said. “This is where we’re a pretty lean organization.“If we can make $20 million on one hotel or $20 million managing 100, it’s a much better use of time and capital for our business model to do that one,” he added. “Even if we have those 100, it still won’t really increase our distribution or have that much leverage over the OTAs or competitors.”That mindset is a result of the changing market conditions that have dominated the hotel industry.“What we’ve seen in the past few years is that the bifurcation of owner and operator has created a huge void in aligned investment,” Tisch said. “There are very few hotel deals around the world where no one has any partners and it’s just a hotel.”That trend has led Loews to be a contrarian in the brand world as it continues to be asset-heavy in an era when most brands prefer to not own real estate.“We don’t ever want to model an IRR based on selling the hotel at cost that we’re owning forever,” Tisch said. “Our best transaction we’ve done in our life, or done 20 or 30 years ago, Miami or partnership in Orlando, the Regency in New York. Those are basically just annuities to us at this point just because they’re on a longer hold period than everyone else, than most, certainly than most of our peers.”";http://hotelnewsnow.com/Articles/272321/Loews-expands-immersive-strategy-to-grow-portfolio;Loews expands ‘immersive’ strategy to grow portfolio
07.02.2018;"Insights from ALIS: Checking in with Alex Tisch of Loews Hotels. In June 2017, Alex Tisch joined Loews Hotels & Co. as executive vice president of commercial and business development. But this wasn’t his introduction to the company—Tisch has been with Loews Corp, of which Loews Hotels is a subsidiary, for more than 10 years. He now serves as vice president of the company in addition to his executive role in commercial and business development. In these roles, Tisch has watched the company thrive in an extended lodging cycle. LODGING spoke with Tisch at the 2018 Americas Lodging Investment Summit about the company’s development and growth strategies and where Loews plans on moving next.This is your first ALIS. How has it been treating you so far?Well, my schedule is packed! That is absolutely a good thing. And the mood is generally optimistic; the cycle end that everyone’s been talking about for the last five years seems to be lasting longer than expected, and people are enjoying it. Our strategy is different than others in the industry and we’ve already closed on a number of deals. You joined Loews Hotels & Co. less than a year ago. What approach are you bringing to the position?Really, to keep doing what we do best. It’s the year of embracing the owner/operator strategy, which is something we’ve been doing for years. We also hold on to assets long term, which really resonates in certain markets. For example, we recently announced an 800-key, $328 million transaction and partnership with Kansas City. We used the same strategy in Miami Beach and Philadelphia 20 to 25 years ago and we still own those hotels. The project is enormous—we’ve already created 2,000 jobs. Many cities don’t really want to welcome new asset owners because, typically, they’ll be gone in five years. They may flip the property and make the city look bad. We don’t want to do that, and building a portfolio of longstanding, legacy properties has helped us build our brand and find further growth.A lot of developers are interested in Kansas City right now. Why is it such an attractive market?When we looked at the city, we were attracted to the Sprint Center, an 800,000 sq. ft. convention center in a beautiful, state-of-the-art building. It just didn’t have a hotel associated with it. This meant it was unable to compete for meetings contracts, which went to cities like Austin, Nashville, and Indianapolis that have hotels associated with their convention centers. So, we put in a bid and were successful. The city is our partner, and we mesh because once the hotel is built, it can market the convention center and, in turn, the convention center can market the hotel. The last hotel in Kansas City of this stature and size was built in 1985. A great city needs a great hotel.Also, the owner/operator model makes us more attractive for projects like this. People work with us because they want someone who will stay in the city for a while. One of our biggest growth avenues is creating long-term partnerships with cities that want a long-term partner.What are some of Loews Hotels & Co.’s other growth avenues?Beyond creating long-term partnerships with cities, we also tend to look for markets with big demand generators, like amusement parks or sports franchises. We have a campus tied to Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla., and we’re in the middle of a 300-key deal in Arlington, Texas. The hotelwill be right between Globe Life Park, where the Texas Rangers play, and AT&T Stadium, which is home of the Dallas Cowboys. Similar to Kansas City, the last hotel built there was in the 1980s. There’s also a lot of demand generators, even beyond the sports teams. It’s close to the largest Six Flags in the world. We also have the Texas Rangers as our equity partner, which is helping us book a lot more rooms direct, rather than through an OTA.What is it like partnering with a city or a sports team? I’m sure that colors how you approach a project.It’s both remarkably time consuming and remarkably rewarding. We allocate as much time as we need because for us, the earnings come from learning how to best manage each asset. It’s much more complex, but the returns are a lot higher.Although we do have brand standards, we also have the flexibility to embrace the locale. In a place like Kansas City, you want something with local flavor; if the brand standards are too much, it’s harder then if you were willing to work with the city. People really embrace that about us.You have a small team compared to many of your competitors. How do you become experts in so many markets so quickly?The firm works really well together because, frankly, everyone has bought into our strategy and wants to work on our new, exciting projects. The exciting part is that people like growth by nature. But on any given day, we could ruin our reputation and have our capital source taken away. We take that very seriously, and our team realizes we won’t be able to grow if we don’t operate all of our hotels properly. I’m leaving here very comfortable with our strategy and with doing something different—there’s nothing wrong with being different. In the long run, it’s going to benefit us.";https://lodgingmagazine.com/insights-from-alis-checking-in-with-alex-tisch-loews/;Insights from ALIS: Checking in with Alex Tisch of Loews Hotels
08.02.2018;"100 N. Main owner plans massive project with Loews hotel, apartments. The owners of 100 N. Main are planning to convert the building into a 550-room Loews Hotel. A New York developer is planning to turn Downtown Memphis' tallest building into a 550-room Loews Hotel, with about 220 apartments. The investors are also planning a 34-story office building next door.Plans for the project inspected by the Memphis Business Journal call for a major transformation of 100 N. Main, the high rise that for several years has been vacant, has been in and out of Shelby County Environmental Court and has been in the hands of several property owners.The renovations of the building's street-level main floor would include 20,000 square feet of retail space, a 7,500-square-foot hotel lobby and a 10,000-square-foot restaurant and bar. Other floors would include a spa, another restaurant, and the hotel rooms and apartments.New York-based Townhouse Management Co., doing business as THM Memphis Acquisitions LLC, is the owner and would-be developer of 100 N. Main. According to the company's website, Townhouse acquires, develops and manages residential, commercial, retail and mixed-use properties throughout the New York metro area.The project plans MBJ reviewed also show 88 N. Main St., located next door to 100 N. Main, with a 12-floor, roughly 1,300-space parking garage at the base of the building. Each of the two floors directly above the garage would contain 35,000-square-foot ballrooms. From there, two office towers would rise, 19 stories each. The towers would contain a total of 467,000 square feet of office space.New York-based ME Architect PC is the architect on the project. Memphis-based ArchInc is also a consultant for the development, providing expertise on the local building code and historic tax credits.Hotel consultant Chuck Pinkowski of Pinkowski & Co. confirmed the hotel plans to MBJ, and ArchInc principal Joseph Hagan confirmed Townhouse's plans for the 88 N. Main office and parking project.However, Hagan cautioned that plans for the buildings have been changing and are still preliminary.Townhouse purchased 100 N. Main at auction a month ago, Jan. 11, for $1 million. It does not yet own the parcels that would be needed for the 88 N. Main project, though it does have some of them under contract.""I think they are serious investors in the city by looking at all the parcels they have purchased or put an option on,"" said Kevin Kane, president and CEO of the Memphis Convention & Visitors Bureau (CVB).The developers will likely seek historic tax credits and local tax breaks for the project, according to ArchInc's Hagan.The closest Loews Hotel to Memphis is the Loews Vanderbilt Hotel in Nashville. Another Loews is scheduled to open next year in St. Louis. The New York-based hospitality company operates 24 luxury and upscale hotels.Paul Steenson, Townhouse Management Co.’s director of development, did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for Loews also did not respond when contacted.";https://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2018/02/08/breaking-100-n-main-owner-plans-massive-project.html;100 N.
