10.11.2017;U.S. toymaker Hasbro makes new approach to buy Mattel: source. (Reuters) - Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) has made an approach to acquire rival Mattel Inc (MAT.O), a source familiar with the matter said on Friday, the latest attempt to combine the two biggest U.S. toymakers in more than two decades.FILE PHOTO: Mattel's Wonder Woman doll is seen at the 114th North American International Toy Fair in New York City, U.S. on February 21, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith/File PhotoA deal would create a toy powerhouse, uniting Hasbro’s My Little Pony, Monopoly and Nerf brands with Mattel’s Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys. A combined company would have more pricing power to negotiate with entertainment studios over TV and movie franchises.Mattel’s stance toward Hasbro in this overture is not clear, and it remains far from certain that a deal will materialize, the source said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.Hasbro and Mattel declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal first reported Hasbro’s latest approach to Mattel.Shares of Mattel jumped about 24 percent in after-hours trading. Hasbro shares rose about 3.3 percent.Hasbro has a market value of about $11 billion after a near 18 percent increase in its stock price so far in 2017. Mattel’s shares have slumped 47 percent this year, valuing the company at $4.8 billion and making it more vulnerable as a takeover target.ADVERTISEMENTThe September bankruptcy of Toys “R” Us, the biggest U.S. toy retailer, highlighted the struggles facing the sector, including online competition and children’s shifting preference for electronics over traditional toys.Mattel has pointed to that bankruptcy as a reason for weak sales.Two weeks ago, Mattel suspended its dividend and Chief Executive Margo Georgiadis, who took the job in January, warned the company would miss its full-year revenue forecast. Mattel’s stock fell to its lowest level since 2009 that day.“Both companies would benefit from a merger, but Mattel stockholders might oppose a deal that values the company on its depressed stock price,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.Hasbro and Mattel have had talks several times over the years, including in 1996 and again sometime in late 2015.Hasbro, which is trying to diversify its revenue stream, also sought to buy U.S. movie studio and entertainment company Lions Gate Entertainment Corp (LGFa.N) this year, but those talks ended without a deal, Reuters reported in August.ADVERTISEMENTThat deal would have given Hasbro a direct pipeline into Hollywood, with more movies and TV shows tied to its toy brands.In 2014, Hasbro held merger discussions with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, the studio behind “Shrek,” but DreamWorks was subsequently bought by Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O).;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mattel-m-a-hasbro/u-s-toymaker-hasbro-makes-new-approach-to-buy-mattel-source-idUSKBN1DA2WV;U.S. toymaker Hasbro makes new approach to buy Mattel: source

10.11.2017;Mattel: It’s Better to Be Lucky Than Good. Shares of Mattel (MAT) are soaring in after-hours trading this evening after the Wall Street Journal reported that Hasbro (HAS) had made overtures about a possible merger. And that's great news for yours truly.Getty ImagesThis past weekend, I recommended investors buy Mattel for reasons, I should add, that had absolutely nothing to do with a possible takeover. Here's how I described the situation with Mattel's stock:The toy maker’s shares have dropped 52% so far this year—and sentiment is so bad it couldn’t even hold on to a takeover-chatter-inspired 11% bounce last Monday, reflecting just what a mess Mattel (MAT) is in. How big? On Oct. 26, it reported a profit that was a fraction of analyst forecasts and suspended its dividend. To make matters worse, S&P cut Mattel’s credit rating to BB from BBB-minus, officially deeming it junk. And then there’s the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy filing to contend with.If ever a company looked set to deliver a lump of coal for investors, it’s Mattel.Yet the maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels knows it has a problem. When it released earnings, management said it would target $650 million in cost cuts through 2019, while also enacting initiatives to reduce unpopular products and create new ones to help boost sales. If it works, Mattel could be a winner.But the call was primarily a valuation one. I noted possible scenarios for Mattel's shares that could see them trade down as low as $8 but as high as $26, with the odds skewed higher than the $13-and-change price at the time.Were they ever. Here's how the WSJ'sDana Mattioli describes the dance Mattel and Hasbro have engaged in:Hasbro Inc. HAS 3.11% has made a takeover offer for rival Mattel Inc., MAT 4.95% according to people familiar with the matter, a combination that would unite the two biggest U.S. toy makers and put Barbie dolls and Nerf guns under the same roof.Hasbro’s approach to Mattel was made recently, one of the people said. The terms of a potential deal couldn’t be learned, and as always, there may not be one.Mattel and Hasbro have been the subjects of similar reports in the past, but nothing came to fruition...obviously. But you don't need a deal to get done to drive a stock's shares higher and that's what's happening with Mattel this evening: Its shares have soared 23% to $17.95 at 5:37 p.m. after gaining 5% in regular trading hours.And sometimes buying a stock because the upside potential outweighs the down is reason enough to buy. Mattel's shares have gained 37% since my recommendation. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than good.;https://www.barrons.com/articles/mattel-its-better-to-be-lucky-than-good-1510354165;Mattel: It’s Better to Be Lucky Than Good
16.11.2017;"Mattel snubs Hasbro's latest attempt to create a giant toy companyGreg Roumeliotis, Reuters Nov. 16, 2017, 8:07 AMThomson ReutersMattel refused Hasbro's latest takeover approach.Mattel has told Hasbro that its proposal undervalues the company and does not sufficiently consider that regulators may reject the deal based on antitrust concerns. (Reuters) - Mattel Inc has rebuffed Hasbro Inc's latest takeover approach, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, casting uncertainty over the potential combination of the world's two largest toy companies.Mattel's rebuttal indicates that Margaret Georgiadis, who took over as the company's chief executive in February, is seeking to drive a hard bargain in negotiations with Hasbro, even though Mattel's stock has significantly underperformed that of Hasbro in the last year.Mattel has informed Hasbro its proposal undervalues the company and does not take sufficiently into account the potential for regulators to reject the deal based on antitrust concerns, the sources said.The terms Hasbro has proposed could not be learned, and it is not clear whether negotiations between the two companies will continue. The companies have engaged in multiple rounds of deal talks over the last two decades.The three sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Hasbro did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Mattel declined to comment.A combination of the two companies would create a toy powerhouse, uniting Hasbro's My Little Pony, Monopoly and Nerf brands with Mattel's Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels toys. It would give Hasbro more pricing power to negotiate with entertainment studios over TV and movie franchises.Hasbro and Mattel have had talks several times over the years, including in 1996 and again sometime in late 2015.Hasbro's more recent outreach to Mattel was from a position of strength. Before the Wall Street Journal reported Hasbro's approach last week, Mattel shares were down 47 percent year-to-date, while Hasbro shares were up 18 percent. Mattel has a market capitalization of $6.3 billion, while Hasbro has a market capitalization of $11.8 billion.The September bankruptcy of Toys ""R"" Us, the biggest U.S. toy retailer, highlighted the struggles facing the sector, including online competition and children's shifting preference for electronics over traditional toys.Mattel has pointed to that bankruptcy as a reason for weak sales. In June, Georgiadis outlined a new strategy for the company that called for expanding its brands and accelerating growth in emerging markets.Two weeks ago, the El Segundo, California-based company suspended its dividend and it would miss its full-year revenue forecast.Hasbro, which is trying to diversify its revenue stream, also sought to buy U.S. movie studio and entertainment company Lions Gate Entertainment Corp this year, but those talks ended without a deal, Reuters reported in August.That deal would have given Hasbro a direct pipeline into Hollywood, with more movies and TV shows tied to its toy brands.In 2014, Hasbro held merger discussions with DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc, the studio behind ""Shrek,"" but DreamWorks was subsequently bought by Comcast Corp.";https://www.businessinsider.com/mattel-snubs-hasbro-takeover-attempt-2017-11?r=US&IR=T;Mattel snubs Hasbro's latest attempt to create a giant toy companyGreg Roumeliotis

Mattel tried to take over Hasbro in 1996.But over the past year the fortunes of the two have diverged markedly, as Mattel grapples with falling sales. Mattel, which is valued at $6bn, is now the smaller firm by many measures.Mattel gives Ken a new lookBarbie out of fashion as Mattel slumpsIts shares have lost almost half their value over the past year and were trading at $17.68 on Monday.Hasbro's shares were $97 - $10 higher than a year ago and giving it a market value double that of Mattel.Mattel's depressed share price may make it an attractive takeover target, but it could also make its leaders reluctant to do a deal now, said Jaime Katz, senior equity analyst for Morningstar.Company comparisonMattel, which owns brands such as Fisher-Price, American Girl and Hot Wheels, sells its products in 150 countries and employs 32,000 people globally, including in manufacturing.In its third quarter results released last month, sales fell 13% to $1.56bn and the firm reported a loss. It suspended its dividend payout to shareholders and accelerated a cost-cutting drive.At Hasbro, sales increased 7% to almost $1.8bn in the most recent quarter. The firm, which has shed manufacturing operations, employs about 5,400 people.Hasbro's new chief executive has used story-telling to boost sales - a strategy that would work well with Mattel's products, said analyst Linda Bolton Weiser, who tracks both companies for financial services firm DA Davidson.Image copyrightAFPImage captionHasbro and Mattel were hit by the problems at Toys R UsIn a research note, Ms Bolton Weiser said the benefits of a combination ""would be immense"" and would likely result in hundreds of millions in savings.The proposed takeover in the 1990s faltered amid US competition concerns.It is not clear how US regulators would respond to a deal today.Analysts estimate the two firms together would account for less than 33% of the US toy market. But the industry is changing rapidly, as Amazon becomes more dominant and stalwarts such as Toys R Us struggle.A potential merger could also run into clashes of corporate culture and other processes, Ms Katz wrote in a research note.""We caution investors that such speculation [about a combination] has fizzled in the past, and a similar fate could occur this go-round,"" she said.";https://www.bbc.com/news/business-41972302;Mattel shares soar on Hasbro takeover rumours
